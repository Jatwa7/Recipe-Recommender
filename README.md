# Recipe-Recommender
The Recipe Recommender is a Python application that suggests recipes based on user-inputted ingredients. It utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to assign weights to each word in the ingredients list and calculates the cosine similarity using the linear_kernel function from scikit-learn to determine the similarity between user-inputted ingredients and the ingredients of available recipes.
